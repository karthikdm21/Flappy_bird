# Flappy_bird
ðŸŽ®

A beginner-friendly Flappy Bird  developed using Pygame to explore and understand the fundamentals of game development in Python. This project is based on a tutorial by Code with Russ and serves as a hands-on introduction to key concepts such as:

  Sprite animations
  Collision detection
  Game physics (gravity, velocity)
  Event handling (mouse and keyboard inputs)
  Scoring systems and UI updates
  
Features

Dynamic Gameplay: Fly the bird through randomly generated pipes.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of your score as you pass through pipes.
Restart Functionality: Restart the game after losing using a custom restart button.
Smooth Animations: Bird flapping animations and rotation physics.
Simple Controls: Click to make the bird flap and avoid obstacles!
